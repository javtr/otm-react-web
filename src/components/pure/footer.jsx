      Trading futures, forex and options contains considerable risk and is not for all investors. An investor can potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
