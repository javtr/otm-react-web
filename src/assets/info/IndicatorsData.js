This indicator allows you to numerically see the volume and delta of price movements. You can easily identify the strength of a pullback or momentum (2). OTM will help you read the information as follows: ",

        txt3: "Delta divergences occur when the delta is not consistent with the price direction. If the price is rising it is normal to have positive delta, sometimes divergences occur and the delta is negative. When this occurs a dotted box will appear as an informative signal (3).

        txt0: "A reliable movement is characterized by consecutive candles and constant volume, however it is important to know its buying or selling strength (delta), since the price action can deceive us. Delta Micro allows you to group the delta by consecutive movements, i.e. candlesticks towards the same direction (1). In this way you will be able to differentiate consistent movements from non-consistent ones. Simple visual identification is vital to avoid missing good trades. Some options offered by this indicator are: ",
