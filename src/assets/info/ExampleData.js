    txt2: "1. Delta value of the ascending wave: in this example it is +614.",

    txt6: "5. Delta value of the downward wave: it is -64, compared to +614 is 10% of the upward wave, this shows us a great imbalance in favor of the upward movement. ",

    txt2: "2. The positive cumulative delta is a great sign of buying pressure and is increasing. ",
    txt3: "3. No response from selling during the pullback wave is a clear sign that buying is in control of the move.",

The retracement wave has a positive delta (+37), this represents an imbalance in favor of buyers even in a bearish retracement move, this is a very strong sign of aggressive buying, the delta divergence box is this cherry on top of the cake that we always want to have in our entries.

Momentum (yellow):This is the first requirement of this pattern, we must have a momentum in favour of the movement in which we are going to take, if we are going to buy we must have delta momentum in favour of buyers (example on the left of the Crude Oil), and if we are going to sell, we must have a momentum in favour of sellers (the other two examples).",

    txt3: "3. Signal (red): OTM Trading, gives us different signals, these appear when some anomaly occurs and we have some advantage in our favour, the signal that appears in these three executions is the signal of effort No result, which indicates that there is a lot of volume but the movement slows down.",
